When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance. Merwin Gerard's teleplay is based on a short story by McKnight Malmar. Malmar's tale was first brought to television in 1962 as an episode of Boris Karloff's THRILLER anthology series. THRILLER stuck very closely to the story, which is kind of a pity, for it could have used a little punching up. Granted Malmar wrote a moderately creepy number, but Gerard (creator of the ONE STEP BEYOND show) adds several clever ingredients that heighten the tension and suspense.\",\n\"positive\",\n\"positive\"],\n [{\n            'v': 12616,\n            'f': \"12616\",\n        },\n\"This person is a so-called entertainer who has to resort to profanity, vulgarity, and slander to try and make others believe he has talent.

Then things should turn around within the next day or so. <br /><br />Until the last fifteen minutes, this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunk's crappy life. His mom dies. His stepmom's a b_tch. His dad dies. He drinks. He gets married. He has kids. He drinks some more. His wife gets mad. He disappoints his kids. The wife threatens to leave. He calls up a reverend late night b/c he wants to kill himself. Then after the recap happens, that's when we get the \\\"Left Behind\\\"-like subtle message.<br /><br />\\\"He needed a paycheck\\\". This is the phrase I had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so I wouldn't lose my respect for Madsen.<br /><br />Madsen drops to his knees and begs Christ's forgiveness. Once he does, he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way. He tells his wife that he's found God and that's good enough for her. Flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church. End the movie as Madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. Final moment? He gives a little dismissive wave to the bar (i.e. sin house) and give a gay, Miami-Vice, after-school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze-frames. See why I had to repeat the phrase? \\\"He needed a paycheck\\\".<br /><br />Man this movie is bad. The B-Grade 80's production values don't help much. The script could have easily been a \\\"Touched By An Angel\\\" episode. It could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials. The acting is wooden and never believable. Even Madsen, of whom I'm a big fan and is the sole reason I sat through this, makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesn't know his a$$ from his elbow yet on camera. 45 minutes into it I started to get discouraged. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to put it away and say that alright, I saw half of it. That's good enough. But no. If I sat through Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit throughout this.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this thing a 1 is for two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great seeing the opening title \\\"Introducing Michael Madsen\\\". Sue me. 2) Some of the Dialogue is so bad that it's classic. I'll stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too.<br /><br />That's about it. To wrap it up ,this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE TARGET, MY BOSS'S DAUGHTER, etc). Now I've gotta rewatch Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him. See ya, Kids.<br /><br />\\\"This stuff's gonna make me go blind, but I'm gonna drink it anyway\\\" - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol<br /><br />\\\"I don't understand!

Having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949's \\\"Late Spring\\\" and 1953's \\\"Tokyo Story\\\", I am convinced that Ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery. It is Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien's keen aspiration to pay homage to Ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film. Among with co-screenwriter T'ien-wen Chu, Hsiao-hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable.<br /><br />The story concerns Y\\u00f4ko, a young Japanese writer researching the life of mid-20th century Taiwanese composer Jiang Wen-Ye in Tokyo after coming back from Taiwan where she taught Japanese. After 25 drawn-out minutes of character set-up, she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in Taiwan. At the same time, Y\\u00f4ko's coffeehouse friend Hajime, who runs a used bookstore, has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her. Hsiao-hsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes. There are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains. While these techniques are consistent with Ozu's style, Hsiao-hsien cannot seem to dive into the characters' psyches the way Ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics, in particular, Y\\u00f4ko's plight seems rather non-committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents' reaction overly passive to hold much interest. In fact, the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it, which makes the film feel interminable.<br /><br />The performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable. J-pop music star Yo Hitoto brings a natural ease to Y\\u00f4ko, while Tadanobu Asano is something of a cipher as Hajime. The rest of the characters barely register, even Nenji Kobayashi and Kimiko Yo as Y\\u00f4ko's parents. Cinematographer Lee Ping-Bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of Ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots. Hitoto speak-sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits, \\\"Hito-Shian\\\". The DVD includes an hour long, French-made documentary, \\\"M\\u00e9tro Lumi\\u00e8re\\\", which actually does help provide some of the context for Hsiao-hsien's approach to the film. It includes excerpts from Ozu's films, in particular, \\\"Equinox Flower\\\", to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either \\\"Tokyo Story\\\" or \\\"Early Summer\\\", the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set-ups. There are also edited interview clips of Hitoto, Asano and Hsiao-hsien, as well as the film's trailer.\",\n\"negative\",\n\"negative\"],\n [{\n            'v': 7115,\n            'f': \"7115\",\n        },\n\"It's New Year's eve, a cop-killer (in the form of, Laurence Fishburne) end up at a precinct that's closing down due till snow.

Most interesting is the return of Ruth Gordon to her Oscar-winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland well-cast as her husband, Roman), but she isn't given much to do--and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway.

When I saw that Ryan Gosling was in the movie and then that he was the main character, I was immediately sucked in and could not move from my couch. The struggle that Leland goes through is such an inspiring story. Everyone has to deal with the same type of thoughts throughout sometime in their life whether it be a small minor detail or something as big as what he's going through. I have to sit and watch the movie again just to catch all the stuff that I may have missed the first time around. As a general comment... I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Gosling fan or anyone who just likes a good movie with a real good story. The fact that there are so many other big stars who all also had great performances is just an added BONUS!

I like Johnny Lee Miller as an actor so I figured it was worth it, and I was definitely rewarded!! His portrayal as a member of the English noble class was by far more accurate than I've seen in the past. The comedy aspect of it left my sides hurting, the costumes weren't awful, and historically, I didn't wince too much. I also noticed the fact that England didn't have a proper sewage system until much later, but anyone who dose not go deep into the minutae of England's past won't notice nor care. Absolutely worth seeing. I highly recommend this movie.\",\n\"positive\",\n\"positive\"],\n [{\n            'v': 46836,\n            'f': \"46836\",\n        },\n\"I just caught an episode about Brad, the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started. I have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart-breaking than his drug addiction. Here's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arriving he insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who ever lived, and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general. Understandably, he is soon asked to leave. Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass?<br /><br />At any rate, I was confused about how the show was put together, since it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. We see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. I didn't even know that was legal to show, but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that? Do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good TV episode?<br /><br />At any rate, it is an enlightening show, because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference, although I have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean-cut. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers here, everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the end, and I have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life. But still, it's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about something like that\\u0085\",\n\"positive\",\n\"Negative\"],\n [{\n            'v': 7077,\n            'f': \"7077\",\n        },\n\"I managed to see this at what I think was the second screening in the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. While I was attending another film two nights later at the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast & crew at another promotional screening of Studs.<br /><br />I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed with the film, I was by no means expecting a masterpiece, but what was presented to me, I believe lacked all the crucial elements of the genre it had set itself into. Before I continue, two things, I accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations, here this is simply not the case. Secondly, I know that it was based on a play (which I haven't read but have been informed that it isn't a shimmering piece of literature), but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that permeate the film.<br /><br />My main problem with the film is the script, forget that it was based on a play, as a sports comedy it simply doesn't work, the down and out team are trying to win a football cup, few of the games are shown (when they are, it is very short) and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements. Having read so far, you might assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relation between a \\\"charlatan\\\" of a manager and his hopeless team. It certainly does not achieve this, I'm not even sure if it was aiming to. Any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral. Overall, I found the script lacking in many respects.<br /><br />I do think the performances and the music were good and technically, the film was well made. But aside from those points, which should be expected from any Irish film at this stage, I left the theater feeling very disappointed.<br /><br />My judgment may seem harsh but I do think there is some hope for a strong national Irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not back that argument. As Studs has become a recommended Dublin Cineworld film (I was part of the audience at that screening), most people would seem to be disagreeing with me, so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the film.\",\n\"negative\",\n\"negative\"],\n [{\n            'v': 13074,\n            'f': \"13074\",\n        },\n\"This film offers many delights and surprises. When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from \\\"Don Giovanni\\\" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film. The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch. You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.<br /><br />Babette is an artist whose medium is food. Perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share her creations so directly.<br /><br />The main theme of this movie, the potential that the sharing of food has to transform how people see each other and how they see the world, is much the same as the theme of \\\"Chololat,\\\" but \\\"Babette's Feast\\\" does not hit you over the head with its message. The townspeople are conservative puritans, but not exaggeratedly oppressive. You come to understand and respect them and ultimately to appreciate their humanity. <br /><br />Many issues are raised for you to reflect on: the nature of art, the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the effect of environment on behavior, the taking of life to give life, among others.<br /><br />The only disappointment for me was General Loewenhielm's speech delivered at the climax of the meal. I expected deep heartfelt observations, but I got some vague mystical ramblings. The speech had such a minimal impact that I hardly remember it.<br /><br />But this understated film leaves a lasting impression. The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop. You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.\",\n\"positive\",\n\"positive\"],\n [{\n            'v': 884,\n            'f': \"884\",\n        },\n\"If you've read Mother Night and enjoyed it so much (as I did) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing - that beyond his story lies Vonnegut himself, and that you can't put a human mind on the screen. His whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance. I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. Does this mean that the movie misses the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. I've seen other movie versions of Vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft. I would not place this movie as one of the best I've seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. By taking Vonnegut's \\\"voice\\\" out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can, Mother Night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.\",\n\"positive\",\n\"positive\"],\n [{\n            'v': 27478,\n            'f': \"27478\",\n        },\n\"Did not know what to expect from from Van Damme's partner & friend /trainer/and his fight choreographer for most of his films.

        "> Despite the existence of a large body of research examining HIV-related stigma in the general population and among vulnerable groups in sub-Saharan Africa, there has been a paucity of consistent scholarship focusing on the behavioral consequences of holding stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV. In particular, while a small but growing body of research suggests that holding stigmatizing beliefs is associated with high-risk sexual behaviors, it is unknown whether this relationship has changed over the past decade, a period in which Africans have experienced improvements in HIV outcomes. To fill this gap, we use data from Demographic and Health Surveys to test two social psychological hypotheses for changes in the association between HIV stigma beliefs and high-risk sexual behaviors in two West African countries: Ghana and Nigeria.\n",

The Function of Abortion in Evangelical and Catholic Politics\",\n\"The Supreme Court's decision to overturn abortion protections was shocking to many, and much of the opposition to abortion rights came from religious organizations and institutions -- Catholic and evangelical Protestant institutions in particular. In this article, I use multiple datasets at three distinct levels of analysis to study how the issue of abortion functions within these two traditions. I find key differences in the function of anti-abortion advocacy between Catholics and evangelical Protestants. For Catholics, abortion is one of many important issues. For evangelical Protestants, on the other hand, abortion is a central, totemic issue that organizes their group identity in a Durkheimian sense. These findings show that just looking at overall opposition to abortion among groups of people does not paint a complete picture, as the issue of abortion can play distinct symbolic roles within different subcultures.\",\n\"Sat, August 19, 12:00 to 1:00pm, Pennsylvania Convention Center, Floor: 100 Level, 113B\",\n\"Joseph Charles Roso, Duke University\",\n\"Sociology of Religion Roundtables\",\n\"https://tinyurl.com/2y47og2s\",\n{\n            'v': 2077952,\n            'f': \"2077952\",\n        },\n\"2 - Sociology of Religion Roundtables - Religion and Politics\",\n\"abstracts/2066691\",\n\"American Sociological Association\",\n\"2 - Sociology of Religion Roundtables - Religion and Politics\",\n\"https://tinyurl.com/23a8edoa\",\n\"website\",\n\"Refereed Roundtable (60 min)\",\n\"Section on Sociology of Religion\",\n\"Sociology of Religion Roundtables\",\n\"Sociology of Religion Roundtables\",\nnull,\ntrue],\n [{\n            'v': 1481,\n            'f': \"1481\",\n        },\n\"Media Coverage and Partnerships: how discourses involving liberal values affect civil unions and same-sex marriages\",\n\"During the past few decades, many wealthy countries have experienced a decline in marriage, accompanied by the diversification of union forms and meanings. Few studies, however, have examined how media narratives may have impacted this process. Media narratives reflect societal trends but may also influence behaviors, reinforcing the change in social norms. In the Second Demographic Transition framework, secularization, individualism, egalitarianism, and, more in general, liberal values, have been considered the main facilitators of the diffusion of new family forms. Thus, the aim of the paper is to examine whether media coverage of discussions concerning liberal values affected the diffusion of civil unions and same-sex marriages, and to understand how the political leaning (conservative-liberal) of newspapers impacts the framing of these issues. To examine how newspaper coverage and narratives have changed over time, we employ the LexisNexis news archive to collect articles from English newspapers, from the half of 2007 to the end of 2019, selecting those containing terms that can be representative of the core values of liberalism (e.g. freedom, fairness, social justice, civil rights). Our preliminary findings seem to suggest that the rise of media coverage regarding liberal discourses has a positive influence on the diffusion of civil unions and same-sex marriages.\",\n\"Sat, August 19, 10:00 to 11:30am, Pennsylvania Convention Center, Floor: 100 Level, 108A\",\n\"Patrizio Lodetti\",\n\"Marriage, En Vogue?

Is it as relevant in 2023? In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the bipartisan bills PRWORA and DOMA into law in the United States. This legislation had direct implications for welfare reform, marriage, and other romantic partnerships. PRWORA, or the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act and DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, sparked controversial conversations among laypersons as well as legislators because they solidified the 1990s symbolic commitment to the meaning and importance of heterosexual marriage in the United States. The premise behind both pieces of legislation was to support and implement programs that supported and safeguarded heterosexual marriage. In 2015, the marriage equality act was passed and wrote into law by President Obama. In December 2022, six months after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, President Biden signed a historic bill that codified same-sex and interracial marriage into law at the federal level. Each act, from restrictive to friendly and inclusive marriage policies, solidified the public importance of marriage as a social institution in the United States. But something remains absent from these public conversations\\u2014the vast number of popular romantic formations that do not fit within the marriage framework. Papers in this session explore the structural components and impediments to marriage by examining the extent to which marriage is available or sought after by individuals from diverging social locations. Papers within this panel asks: What unions exists beyond marriage? How are non-marriage alternatives surviving and thriving? And how do these unions experience or reconcile social inequality? Through examining romantic bonds beyond the scope of marriage, this panel pushes research on marriages, civil unions, and cohabitation in new directions.\",\nfalse],\n [{\n            'v': 3039,\n            'f': \"3039\",\n        },\n\"Data Values: Digital Surveillance and the New Epistemology of Psychiatry\",\n\"Companies and academic researchers have started to adapt techniques of digital surveillance to study mental illness and provide mental healthcare. Digital psychiatry researchers argue that behavior that can be tracked by computers and smart devices\\u2014including location, communication patterns, and Internet browsing behavior\\u2014will revolutionize understanding and treatment of mental illness. Digital surveillance stands to completely reconfigure the creation of psychiatric knowledge. Yet the epistemological shifts that define digital psychiatry also have a variety of moral consequences. In this paper, I argue the new epistemology of psychiatry also constitutes a form of moral innovation. Drawing on ethnographic research and semi-structured interviews, I analyze how digital surveillance modifies the values that guide psychiatry. \\n \\nFirst, I evaluate the values engendered by digital psychiatry. Like other projects of scientific innovation, digital psychiatry prizes objectivity. Researchers also value digital surveillance's passivity. Digital psychiatry often works with sensed data, collected without patients' conscious input. Researchers argue that digital surveillance replaces the subjectiveness of self-reported information with objective, quantitative data. Second, I analyze these values' effects. I argue a focus on digital surveillance demotes patients' perspectives. As sensed data is taken as fact, patients' interpretive work is devalued. Meanwhile, the digital surveillance paradigm amounts to an expansion of the clinic: all data becomes health data. Moving away from psychiatry's classic confessional model, digital psychiatry instead observes human behavior as it occurs. I conclude with discussion of the implications of this moral ideology of behaviorism in other arenas of healthcare and in other domains of social life.\",\n\"Sat, August 19, 12:00 to 1:30pm, Marriott Philadelphia Downtown, Floor: Level 4, Franklin Hall 11\",\n\"Mira Vale, University of Michigan\",\n\"Technology and the Body\",\n\"https://tinyurl.com/2yopdkm9\",\n{\n            'v': 2041685,\n            'f': \"2041685\",\n        },\n\"\",\n\"abstracts/2065872\",\n\"American Sociological Association\",\n\"Technology and the Body\",\n\"https://tinyurl.com/23kgj4h3\",\n\"website\",\n\"Paper Session (90 min)\",\n\"Section on Science, Knowledge, and Technology\",\n\"Open Session on Issues Related to Science, Knowledge, and Technology\",\n\"\",\n\"Papers in this session consider the intersections of science, knowledge, technology, and the body, with an emphasis on novel scientific approaches and emergent technologies.\",\ntrue]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"string\", \"title\"], [\"string\", \"abstract\"], [\"string\", \"date\"], [\"string\", \"authors\"], [\"string\", \"event_x\"], [\"string\", \"url\"], [\"number\", \"session_id\"], [\"string\", \"roundtable\"], [\"string\", \"id\"], [\"string\", \"og:site_name\"], [\"string\", \"og:title\"], [\"string\", \"og:url\"], [\"string\", \"og:type\"], [\"string\", \"type\"], [\"string\", \"Organizer\"], [\"string\", \"sub2\"], [\"string\", \"event_y\"], [\"string\", \"og:description\"], [\"string\", \"section\"]],\n        columnOptions: [{\"width\": \"1px\", \"className\": \"index_column\"}],\n        rowsPerPage: 25,\n        helpUrl: \"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/data_table.ipynb\",\n        suppressOutputScrolling: true,\n        minimumWidth: undefined,\n      });\n      \n      function appendQuickchartButton(parentElement) {\n        let quickchartButtonContainerElement = document.createElement('div');\n        quickchartButtonContainerElement.innerHTML = `\n    <div id=\"df-8929abb9-d063-4d7f-aae7-f63c39b85cf5\">\n      <button class=\"colab-df-quickchart\" onclick=\"quickchart('df-8929abb9-d063-4d7f-aae7-f63c39b85cf5')\"\n              title=\"Suggest charts.\"\n              style=\"display:none;\">\n\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n     width=\"24px\">\n    <g>\n        <path d=\"M19 3H5c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V5c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zM9 17H7v-7h2v7zm4 0h-2V7h2v10zm4 0h-2v-4h2v4z\"/>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n      </button>\n    </div>\n\n<style>\n  .colab-df-quickchart {\n    background-color: #E8F0FE;\n    border: none;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    display: none;\n    fill: #1967D2;\n    height: 32px;\n    padding: 0 0 0 0;\n    width: 32px;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart:hover {\n    background-color: #E2EBFA;\n    box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n    fill: #174EA6;\n  }\n\n  [theme=dark] .colab-df-quickchart {\n    background-color: #3B4455;\n    fill: #D2E3FC;\n  }\n\n  [theme=dark] .colab-df-quickchart:hover {\n    background-color: #434B5C;\n    box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n    filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n    fill: #FFFFFF;\n  }\n</style>\n\n    <script>\n      async function quickchart(key) {\n        const containerElement = document.querySelector('#' + key);\n        const charts = await google.colab.kernel.invokeFunction(\n            'suggestCharts', [key], {});\n      }\n    </script>\n`;\n        parentElement.appendChild(quickchartButtonContainerElement);\n        \nfunction displayQuickchartButton(domScope) {\n  let quickchartButtonEl =\n    domScope.querySelector('#df-8929abb9-d063-4d7f-aae7-f63c39b85cf5 button.colab-df-quickchart');\n  quickchartButtonEl.style.display =\n    google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

In this paper we suggest that Social Security disability programs play an important role in ameliorating the demographic consequences of long-term economic and population change, particularly in rural areas that experience depopulation loss. This project leverages a mixed-method study of disability that draws on in-depth interviews in two rural counties and analysis of nationally representative county-level data from the U.S Census Bureau and Social Security Administration. Preliminary quantitative and qualitative evidence suggests with counties that saw declines in core industries since the 1970s, like mining and manufacturing, there is an increase in people who enrolled in disability.  However, this trend is mitigated if a county saw an increase in service sector growth.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        },\n\"survey on creative workers\",\n\"occupation as distinct and exclusive communities of workers; polyoccupationalism\",\n\"Yes\",\n\"quantitative\",\n\"Past research has posited that occupations are distinct and exclusive communities of workers and used single-entry questions in surveys to measure occupational self-identification. Our study challenges that view by reporting the existence of polyoccupationalism, or workers' simultaneous identification with multiple occupations. We predict that this phenomenon co-occurs with postindustrial forms of work organization and that its expression varies with workers' position in the occupational structure. Using a survey on creative workers that uniquely allowed respondents to identify with multiple occupations, we find that they report higher levels of polyoccupationalism when their work is more contract- and project-based, net of other individual and occupational attributes. We further show that polyoccupationalism takes different forms at the top and at the bottom of the occupational structure: while the polyoccupationalism of high-status \\\"entrepreneurs\\\" stretches expertise \\u2013 they identify with occupations that are similar in status but functionally distinct \\u2013, that of lower-status \\\"hustlers\\\" stretches status \\u2013 the occupations they report involve similar tasks but stand farther apart on the occupational status scale. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding workers' occupational identities and the dynamics of occupational hierarchies.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 2,\n            'f': \"2\",\n        },\n\"Original fieldwork with dual national Colombian-Venezuelan individuals who were arbitrarily deprived of their nationality in Colombia\",\n\"Unclear\",\n\"Unclear\",\n\"qualitative\",\n\"Between 2021 and 2022, 40,000 mostly dual national Colombian-Venezuelan individuals were arbitrarily deprived of their nationality in Colombia. This paper will present an analysis of the effects of arbitrary deprivation in Colombia, based on original fieldwork with this hard to reach population. The author conducted in-depth interviews with people deprived of their nationality in Colombia through a community-engaged research project with legal nonprofit organizations that were engaged in strategic litigation. Current findings show that the deprivation of nationality creates multidimensional harm on the individual and spillover effects (Aranda 2014) that affect families, especially children of those deprived of citizenship.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 3,\n            'f': \"3\",\n        },\n\"Panama Papers and other leaks\",\n\"social capital\",\n\"Unclear\",\n\"quantitative\",\n\"Social capital refers to community connectedness and the trust and cooperation it produces. The literature on social capital typically emphasizes its pro-social effects, including reduction of crime and deviance. This article, instead, focuses on the negative or anti-social potential of social capital. We analyze the relationship between two forms of social capital \\u2013 bonding (within-group) and bridging (across-group) social capital \\u2013 and tax avoidance by wealthy Americans. We use a novel dataset constructed using the Panama Papers and other leaks, which identify the addresses of over 2,000 U.S. residents who engaged in offshore tax avoidance, and analyze the social and economic characteristics of the communities they live in. Our analysis produced three main findings. First, communities with a higher number of civic organizations are more likely to be home to tax avoiders. This challenges the common wisdom, which associates civic organizations with bridging social capital. Instead, we find, civic organizations may increase bonding social capital among wealthy elites, lowering adherence to broader social norms. Second, communities with high income inequality are also more likely to host tax avoiders. Finally, communities that show patriotic behavior \\u2013 measured by census participation and military service \\u2013 have lower levels of tax avoidance, suggesting that patriotism may operate as bridging social capital. Our findings empirically establish the concept of negative social capital and explore the factors associated with it. They also advance the analytic distinction between bonding and bridging social capital while highlighting the role of patriotism as a form of bridging social capital. Finally, we demonstrate that elite behavior and tax avoidance decisions are affected by community context and social capital.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 4,\n            'f': \"4\",\n        },\n\"Survey results collected from affected residents\",\n\"Psychology and sociology\",\n\"Yes\",\n\"quantitative\",\n\"There is growing concern that climate change and its associated environmental hazards pose a new type of existential threat to humanity and danger to public health \\u2014 with new terms such as \\\"climate distress\\\" and \\\"eco-anxiety\\\" emerging daily to capture its impacts. Despite that, academic research pertaining to climate-related worries remains sparse and largely confined to psychology, which broadly finds that a significant number of people globally now share these eco-anxieties and worries. In this study, we draw on these psychological and other related sociological insights to assess if exposures to flood-triggered toxic contamination uniquely influences residents' future flood worries, and if they vary with respect to the exposure of different racial groups through leveraging the case of Hurricane Harvey. Survey results collected from affected residents a year after the event revealed that neighborhood contamination was not only consistently elevated amongst nonwhite bodies and places but was also strongly associated with heightened future flood worries \\u2014 more so than having one's home flood during the event or suspicions that climate change will contribute to even more severe flood events in the future. The implication of these findings indicates that while the existential threat of climate change and associated disasters may be rising overall, there are important social dynamics also operating to differentiate how that threat and related worries are being experienced and processed. Findings also imply that there exists a particular type of climate inequity lurking behind general claims of existential threat:  psychic uncertainty, or toxic fear, triggered by climate contamination.\"]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"string\", \"data\"], [\"string\", \"theory\"], [\"string\", \"hypothesis\"], [\"string\", \"method\"], [\"string\", \"abstract\"]],\n        columnOptions: [{\"width\": \"1px\", \"className\": \"index_column\"}],\n        rowsPerPage: 25,\n        helpUrl: \"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/data_table.ipynb\",\n        suppressOutputScrolling: true,\n        minimumWidth: undefined,\n      });\n      \n      function appendQuickchartButton(parentElement) {\n        let quickchartButtonContainerElement = document.createElement('div');\n        quickchartButtonContainerElement.innerHTML = `\n    <div id=\"df-1769fdbc-e501-42ac-9d7c-b40568fb23a7\">\n      <button class=\"colab-df-quickchart\" onclick=\"quickchart('df-1769fdbc-e501-42ac-9d7c-b40568fb23a7')\"\n              title=\"Suggest charts.\"\n              style=\"display:none;\">\n\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n     width=\"24px\">\n    <g>\n        <path d=\"M19 3H5c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V5c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zM9 17H7v-7h2v7zm4 0h-2V7h2v10zm4 0h-2v-4h2v4z\"/>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n      </button>\n    </div>\n\n<style>\n  .colab-df-quickchart {\n    background-color: #E8F0FE;\n    border: none;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    display: none;\n    fill: #1967D2;\n    height: 32px;\n    padding: 0 0 0 0;\n    width: 32px;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart:hover {\n    background-color: #E2EBFA;\n    box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n    fill: #174EA6;\n  }\n\n  [theme=dark] .colab-df-quickchart {\n    background-color: #3B4455;\n    fill: #D2E3FC;\n  }\n\n  [theme=dark] .colab-df-quickchart:hover {\n    background-color: #434B5C;\n    box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n    filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n    fill: #FFFFFF;\n  }\n</style>\n\n    <script>\n      async function quickchart(key) {\n        const containerElement = document.querySelector('#' + key);\n        const charts = await google.colab.kernel.invokeFunction(\n            'suggestCharts', [key], {});\n      }\n    </script>\n`;\n        parentElement.appendChild(quickchartButtonContainerElement);\n        \nfunction displayQuickchartButton(domScope) {\n  let quickchartButtonEl =\n    domScope.querySelector('#df-1769fdbc-e501-42ac-9d7c-b40568fb23a7 button.colab-df-quickchart');\n  quickchartButtonEl.style.display =\n    google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

        "> Advocates rallied for LGBTQ rights at the Kentucky Capitol on Wednesday, calling for lawmakers to stop advancing bills that would ban trans girls from participating in girls sports. Supporters also renewed their call for lawmakers to pass a statewide fairness ordinance—banning discrimination based on sexual orientation—and to approve a bill that would prohibit conversion therapy. Keturah Herron—a Democratic candidate for a legislative seat in Louisville who identifies as queer, masculine-presenting woman—said she experienced intolerance at the legislature during her time as a lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union. She said at one point she was told by a woman to use a different bathroom. “I understand I am supposed to be in this space. However, I understand that my mere presence makes some people uncomfortable. My advice to them: Get used to it,” Herron said. Herron is running in a special election on Feb. 22 for House District 42 against Republican Judy Martin Stallard. Over the last week, Republicans have advanced bills in both the House and Senate that would ban transgender girls from participating in girls sports, even though there haven’t been any complaints in Kentucky about such rare cases. As the Senate prepared to debate one of those bills on Wednesday, chants from the rally could be heard in the chamber, forcing lawmakers to keep the doors closed. Donzella Lee, a pastor and executive director of the Franklin-Simpson Human Rights Commission, encouraged rallygoers to make noise. “Today the Senate is planning to vote on one of these bills, and I want you to tell them as loud and proud as you can: Let kids play,” Lee shouted to the crowd. The annual event featured a long list of Democratic speakers, including Gov. Andy Beshear, who was the first governor to ever speak at the rally in 2020. “We cannot possibly reach our fullest potential unless every single one of our families, every single one of our people feels supported and valued to be themselves,” Beshear said. U.S. Senate candidate Charles Booker said Republican lawmakers were pushing for anti-trans legislation while ignoring other priorities. “They’d rather focus on banning trans youth from playing in sports than making sure you have health care. They would rather ban trans youth from playing in sports than making sure you have clean water,” Booker said. Rep. Attica Scott, a Democrat from Louisville, said the fight for LGBTQ rights goes hand-in-hand with the fight against racism. “We can’t all get wherever there is unless we get there together,” Scott said. Shortly after the rally, the Senate passed Senate Bill 83, banning trans girls from playing girls sports in middle school and high school, with a vote of 27-8. The House will now consider the measure.\n",
